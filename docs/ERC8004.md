# ERC‑8004 integration (off-chain)

AGIJobManager keeps escrow and settlement logic fully on-chain and avoids external dependencies in critical flows. ERC‑8004 integration is intentionally **off-chain** in this repository.

## What is ERC‑8004?
ERC‑8004 standardizes how agent identity, reputation, and validation signals are published so other systems can index and consume them consistently. See the canonical spec and references:

- EIP: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004
- ERC document: https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-8004.md
- Reference contracts: https://github.com/erc-8004/erc-8004-contracts

## Why AGIJobManager is not hardwired to ERC‑8004
Coupling escrow settlement to an external registry would introduce **liveness and dependency risks** (e.g., if a registry or indexer is unavailable). AGIJobManager therefore remains a self-contained enforcement layer, while ERC‑8004 operates as a signaling layer.

## Recommended integration pattern (signaling → enforcement)
1. **Publish trust signals** via ERC‑8004 (identity, reputation, validation outcomes).
2. **Index and rank** those signals off-chain.
3. **Translate policy into allowlists** (Merkle roots at deployment, explicit allowlists/blacklists during operation).
4. **Use AGIJobManager** as the on-chain escrow and settlement anchor.

## Agent/validator registration guidance
Agents and validators should register in ERC‑8004 using a registration file that includes a `services` array. A minimal example lives in:

- `integrations/erc8004/examples/registration.json`

Host the registration JSON via HTTPS or IPFS and reference it from the ERC‑8004 identity token’s metadata (exact field depends on the registry implementation you use).

## Metrics from AGIJobManager → ERC‑8004 signals
AGIJobManager emits job lifecycle events that can be mapped to reputation metrics. The adapter in `integrations/erc8004/` aggregates these into per‑agent metrics, then encodes them as ERC‑8004 signals with `value` and `valueDecimals` (supporting decimals and negative values).

Recommended tag1 examples:
- `successRate`
- `disputeRate`
- `uptime`
- `responseTime`
- `blocktimeFreshness`
- `revenues`
- `ownerVerified`

Encoding examples:
- successRate 99.80% → `value=9980`, `valueDecimals=2`
- downvote −1 → `value=-1`, `valueDecimals=0`
- revenues $556,000 → `value=556000`, `valueDecimals=0`

## Trusted client set guidance
For AGIJobManager feedback, a strong eligibility set for “trusted clients” is: addresses that actually created paid jobs (derived from `JobCreated` events). This reduces sybil feedback and mirrors real economic participation.

## Off-chain adapter
See the adapter README and spec for how events map into metrics and how to export JSON artifacts:
