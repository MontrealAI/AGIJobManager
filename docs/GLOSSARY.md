# Glossary

- **Job**: A paid task created by an employer and funded in escrow.
- **Escrow**: The AGI tokens held by the contract until the job is completed or resolved.
- **Validation**: Approvals or disapprovals from validators that determine job completion or dispute.
- **Dispute**: A flagged job that needs moderator resolution.
- **Resolution string**: The text used by a moderator to resolve a dispute. Only “agent win” or “employer win” trigger settlement.
- **Token approval / allowance**: Permission granted to the contract to move AGI tokens on your behalf.
- **ENS namehash / node / label**: ENS identifiers. The **label** is a single subdomain (e.g., `helper`), and the **node** is its hashed form.
- **NameWrapper**: The ENS wrapper contract used for wrapped name ownership checks.
- **Merkle root / proof / leaf**: Cryptographic components of an allowlist. The root is stored on‑chain; the proof proves your wallet is in the list; the leaf is your wallet hash.
