# Glossary (short)

- **Job**: A funded task created by an employer, assigned to an agent, and validated by validators.
- **Escrow**: The job payout held by the contract until completion or dispute resolution.
- **Validation**: Approving or disapproving a job outcome as a validator.
- **Dispute**: A flag that pauses normal completion and requires moderator resolution.
- **Resolution string**: The moderator input that decides the dispute (`agent win`, `employer win`, or any other string).
- **Token approval / allowance**: Permission given to the contract to transfer tokens from your wallet.
- **ENS namehash / node / label**: ENS uses hashes of labels to form a node. The UI asks for the **label only**.
- **NameWrapper**: The ENS contract that represents wrapped names and their ownership.
- **Merkle root / proof / leaf**: The root is published on‑chain; a proof is a short path; a leaf is the hashed address.
