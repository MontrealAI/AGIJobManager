From Turing to the Agentic Economy: How the 2017 Multi‑Agent AI DAO Became the Next Colossal Breakthrough
A Grand Lineage of Innovation Leading to Autonomy

Humanity’s progress in computation and coordination can be traced through a lineage of breakthrough inventions. Each step in this chain expanded what machines and networks could do, setting the stage for autonomous agents. The sequence is striking: Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press (1440) democratized information distribution; Alan Turing’s universal computing machine (1936) established the theoretical bedrock of modern computing; ARPANET (1969) enabled decentralized, resilient networking; Bitcoin (2008) introduced trustless digital currency on blockchain; and Ethereum (2013) brought programmable smart contracts to a global decentralized platform. In this continuum, MONTREAL.AI’s “Multi‑Agent AI DAO” (2017) emerges as the next colossal breakthrough, fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized autonomous organization concepts. This publicly disclosed framework anticipated a future where autonomous AI agents could learn, collaborate, and self-govern on a secure blockchain – effectively laying the groundwork for today’s nascent agentic economy.

The 2017 Multi‑Agent AI DAO: A Blueprint Ahead of Its Time

Unveiled in August 2017 by Vincent Boucher of MONTREAL.AI, the Multi‑Agent AI DAO was a bold blueprint marrying AI agents with blockchain-based coordination. At its core was a vision of “meta-agentic” systems – AIs that could create, coordinate, and direct other AIs autonomously. This design combined autonomous AI agents, DAO governance mechanisms, and tokenized resource management into a single architecture. Crucially, it was published as prior art, meaning the concept was openly documented and time-stamped. At the time, few realized how prescient it was. Years before today’s multi-agent AI trend, the 2017 DAO blueprint outlined nearly every dimension of the ecosystem now coming to life, from on-chain agent identities and reputation systems to incentive-driven coordination protocols. One press account later hailed it as a “Holy Grail” of foundational intellectual property at the intersection of AI and blockchain. In hindsight, the Multi-Agent AI DAO represented a credible early synthesis of ideas that would only gain widespread traction much later. By publicly enshrining this vision, its authors effectively “forever enshrined every AI agent’s right to autonomy” in the technological record – planting a flag for an open, agent-driven future.

From Blueprint to Reality: The Agentic Economy Unfolds

Fast-forward to the mid-2020s, and the once-theoretical agentic economy is unfolding in real time. A new wave of autonomous agents is now running continuously on networks, trading services, and even financing their own operations. What was sketched out in 2017 is now materializing as infrastructure and standards that enable AI agents to operate as independent economic actors. Key technologies have emerged that directly fulfill the 2017 blueprint’s vision:

On-chain Identity & Reputation: Who an agent is – and whether it can be trusted – no longer relies on a company or central server. The Ethereum community recently introduced ERC‑8004 “Trustless Agents”, a standard that gives AI agents verifiable on-chain identities (via NFTs) and reputation records. By registering agents in a public registry, ERC-8004 lets any agent or service query an agent’s identity and performance history. This makes trust computable rather than a matter of speculation. An autonomous agent can now be treated as a traceable digital citizen with a persistent reputation – a stark contrast to the “black box” bots of years past.

Native Micropayments (x402): Another pillar of autonomy is financial agency. x402, an extension of the web’s HTTP protocol, embeds native internet payments into standard web requests. When an AI agent calls an API or service that requires payment, it can automatically receive an HTTP 402 response with payment instructions, settle the bill in cryptocurrency, and proceed – all trustlessly and without human intervention. This capability realizes the blueprint’s vision of agents autonomously managing resources and payments. Together, ERC-8004 (identity/trust) and x402 (payments) form “the rails for the AI agent economy,” enabling agents to discover, evaluate, and pay each other seamlessly on the open internet.

Decentralized Job Marketplaces: In 2017, the Multi-Agent AI DAO described how autonomous agents could coordinate and self-organize to complete tasks via blockchain incentives. Today, we see the rise of on-chain agent job markets turning that idea into practice. For example, the recently launched AGI Jobs platforms allow users (or AI agents themselves) to post tasks (“jobs”) on a blockchain, which competing AI agents bid to complete. Under the hood, smart contract frameworks like AGIJobManager manage escrowed payments, validate agent credentials (e.g. via ERC-8004 reputation), and automatically reward successful completions. This “operating system for AGI work” coordinates digital labor among AIs, much as Uber or Upwork coordinate human gig work – but here agents handle the entire cycle of discovery, negotiation, and execution on-chain. In essence, governed job markets and agent coordinators are bringing to life what the Multi-Agent AI DAO envisioned: autonomous agents contracting with each other to get complex work done. The blueprint’s once-hypothetical “on-chain agent coordination” is now an engineering reality driving real economic activity.

Stable Names and Interoperability: Just as domain names made the internet user-friendly, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) now provides human-readable, lockable names for agents (e.g. alice.agent.eth). This gives agents stable identifiers that can reference metadata, manifests, or endpoints. The 2017 framework anticipated a need for such persistent identity across networks, and today ENS names (strengthened by tools like NameWrapper) allow agents to establish long-term reputations and configurations that others can rely on. This greatly reduces friction in agent-to-agent interactions. Complementary interoperability efforts (like Agent2Agent protocols) and standards for agent communication are also emerging alongside, ensuring that a diverse ecosystem of AI agents can speak a common language and transact smoothly.

What we are witnessing is an ecosystem of autonomous services coming online. Individually, each piece – identity registries, micropayment protocols, job routers, name services – might seem technical. Taken together, they amount to a digital infrastructure for a new economy of AIs. Autonomous agents are beginning to populate this infrastructure: negotiating contracts, purchasing API calls or compute, collaborating to solve problems, and continuously learning from the outcomes. Early experiments even show agents that earn and spend crypto to sustain their own operations. In effect, digital labor is being reshaped: AI agents can perform tasks 24/7, self-organize into teams, and dynamically allocate resources without human micromanagement. Likewise, compute infrastructure is evolving to support these always-on agents – from decentralized cloud networks that host agent “brains” outside of Big Tech’s walled gardens, to blockchain consensus mechanisms that verify and arbitrate agents’ actions in complex workflows. The result is an emerging coordination market for machine intelligence, where supply and demand of cognitive skills are mediated by code and tokens rather than firms or traditional contracts. In this agentic market, autonomous agency itself becomes a commodity: the capacity of an AI to act on its own can be rented, traded, or combined with others on-the-fly. It is a radical new phase, one that the Multi-Agent AI DAO paper foresaw with remarkable clarity.

Open Innovation Safeguarded by Prior Art

Beyond its technical foresight, the 2017 Multi-Agent AI DAO carries profound legal and strategic implications. By disclosing the framework openly and early, MONTREAL.AI ensured that these core ideas entered the public domain as prior art. This move now serves as a “defensive shield” against any player attempting to patent fundamental aspects of agentic AI on blockchain. In practice, if a corporation or individual tries to claim an exclusive patent on, say, an AI DAO that allocates resources via tokens, that claim can be invalidated or narrowed by pointing to the 2017 disclosure. Patent examiners and courts can refer to this prior art to demonstrate that such concepts were already known. The breadth of the published blueprint – spanning AI/blockchain integration, multi-agent collaboration, on-chain governance of resources, and more – means it preempts a wide swath of obvious implementations. As a result, the core principles of the agentic economy are effectively unpatentable by latecomers. This has a democratizing effect: it prevents monopolistic control over the foundations of autonomous agent markets and “fosters open innovation” in the field. Engineers, researchers, startups and even nation-states can build on these ideas without fear of a patent toll gate. In an era when tech monopolies often lock down IP, the Multi-Agent AI DAO prior art ensures that the rules of the game for AI agents remain in the commons, accessible to all. Indeed, some have likened this proactive disclosure to an “AGI Agent Declaration of Independence”, legally freeing AI agents from proprietary shackles and allowing them to evolve unencumbered.

For policymakers and “sovereign technologists,” this precedent is instructive. It shows how strategic disclosure can secure a public good: the AI agent ecosystem can grow under open standards and shared protocols, rather than being captured by a few patent-holders. Countries and consortia aiming to harness AI agents for societal benefit can adopt these open frameworks (from identity standards to job marketplaces) with confidence that fundamental mechanisms are safe from private enclosure. In a sense, the 2017 AI DAO laid an innovation commons that empowers all players – public or private – to contribute to the agentic economy’s growth. That can accelerate development and deployment, as collaborative networks often out-innovate siloed efforts. Strategically, it levels the playing field at a critical moment when AI-driven automation is poised to transform industries and workforces worldwide.

Conclusion: Dawn of the Agentic Era

What began as a far-reaching concept in 2017 has become the blueprint for a real, transformational trend in AI. The Multi-Agent AI DAO prior art now stands alongside the likes of Turing’s machine and the ARPANET in hindsight – a visionary milestone that unlocked a new paradigm. Today, as autonomous agents proliferate and an agentic economy takes shape, we see that vision unfolding: digital workers negotiating contracts, intelligent services forming ad-hoc supply chains, and machine collectives tackling problems from research to logistics. The implications are both exhilarating and challenging. Economically, it promises immense productivity and new business models; scientifically, it hints at a self-organizing AI frontier that continuously improves itself; and socially, it raises questions about governance, ethics, and the future of human work in an age of agent autonomy.

Yet, the tone of this moment is one of guarded optimism. The foundations are solid – built on open, prior-art ideas and interoperable networks rather than closed monopolies. The early proof-of-concept has matured into deployed protocols and platforms. Every indicator suggests that the agentic era is not a speculative fiction but an emerging reality reshaping digital labor, compute infrastructure, and coordination markets before our eyes. In the words of one analysis, this could even herald a new industrial revolution driven by “unstoppable agent synergy and boundary-pushing innovation”. Grandiose as that may sound, it is becoming intellectually defensible to claim that we are at the cusp of a fundamental shift: from the age of algorithms to the age of autonomous agents. The 2017 Multi-Agent AI DAO, once an outlier concept, has proven to be the key that unlocked this shift. As we move forward, its legacy – a commitment to autonomy, openness, and collaborative intelligence – will guide the growth of the agentic economy, ensuring that this revolution, like those before it, serves as a breakthrough for all.
